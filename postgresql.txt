Ideally, you want to create a test user when you access a database in development.

Firstly, install PostgreSQL via Homebrew (if using a Mac)

PostgresSQL Login Command: `psql -u postgres` 
    (If this is your first login, you will likely be prompted to enter a new password for the default `postgres` user)

Once you gain access to postgres, create a new database called "adminjs_panel": `CREATE DATABASE adminjs_panel`

Use `\l` to list all of your databases.

Now, create a new test user: `CREATE USER mr_bean1 WITH PASSWORD 'password'`

Use CMD + D\Ctrl + D, to exit postgres, i.e, logout out of postgres.

Now, login with the newly created test user: `psql -U mr_bean1 -d adminjs_panel` 
    (
        `-d`, specifies a database. We must specify a database in order to login. If left unspecified, a database matching the username,
         is used. An error will occur, if no database matching the username is found, thus preventing us from logging in. 
    )
